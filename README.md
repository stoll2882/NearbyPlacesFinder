# NearbyPlacesFinder
## Utilizes GooglePlaces API to fetch and recieve data about places nearby to user
- To view project, enter xcworkspace and view project files
- Can then clone straight to XCode for easy access and product loading
- Need to use seperate APIKey as mine is in .gitignore for security purposes :)
